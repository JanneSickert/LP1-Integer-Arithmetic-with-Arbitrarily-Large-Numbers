1. Extract the rsn170330.zip 

2. Compile: 
	$javac rsn170330/*.java

3. Run: 
	$java rsn170330.TestLP1 <val>
	where val can be an Integer = {0, 1, 2, ..., 6}

4. You may use the driver code in main, else you can input you own.

Note:
 - Have tried to comment every important logic we used while coding the project.
 - Would really appreciate if you wish to give the demo by ourselves.
